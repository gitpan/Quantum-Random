NAME
    Quantum::Random - Optical quantum random number generator front-end

SYNOPSIS
      package Your::Package;

      use strict;
      use Quantum::Random qw(quantum_random);

      my @numbers = quantum_random(10, 5);

      die "Error: $Quantum::Random::Error\n" unless @numbers;

      print join ', ', @numbers;

DESCRIPTION
    Quantum::Random is a front-end to the optical quantum random number
    generator at the Computer Science department of the University of
    Geneva. For details on the generator, visit:
    http://www.randomnumbers.info/

    The site states, "The Computer Science department of the University of
    Geneva has developed a server/client application for scientist from
    around the world to be able to download random numbers directly in the
    C, C+, Fortran or Java codes [sic] used for their simulations."

    As they have no stated plans for developing a perl interface, I have
    taken it upon myself to author one.

USAGE
    The subroutine 'quantum_random' will be exported into your namespace as
    shown above. It accepts two mandatory arguments. The first argument
    represents the number of random numbers you want (i.e., the quantity)
    and must be between 1 and 1000. The second argument represents the
    maximum number that you want any given random number to be (i.e., the
    maximum) and must be between 1 and 10000. On success, you will be
    returned a list of random numbers. On failure, you will be returned an
    empty set and can get details on the failure by checking the contents of
    $Quantum::Random::Error.

CAVEATS

    random number generator site. It is the user's responsibility to ensure
    that they are in compliance with any respective terms of use clauses for
